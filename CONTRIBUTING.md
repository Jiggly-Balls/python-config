I appreciate any contributions made to this project. If you notice any mistakes, or you want to recommend me some changes to my configuration, don't hesitate to make a PR.

# Guidelines

When making a PR please title it appropriately like so-

- For correction in any form of mistake, prefix your title with `[FIX]`. Like: `[FIX] Grammar Eror`.
- For any form of suggestions, prefix your title with `[FEATURE]`. Like: `[FEATURE] Additional Ruff Rule Select`.
- If your suggestion doesn't fall in those two catagories, you can prefix it with `[OTHER]`.

In the body of your PR, please describe briefly on the contribution you're making.

Thank you.
